Governance
==========
bio.tools follows a simple `governance model <https://bio.tools/governance>`_ of three tiers under the leadership of the 
`Danish ELIXIR node <http://elixir-denmark.org>`_ (Professor Søren Brunak, Head of Node).  Development on the ground is led by two Technical Coordinators: `Emil Rydza <mailto:ekry@dtu.dk>`_ is leading the software development and `Jon Ison <mailto:jison@cbs.dtu.dk>`_ is leading the collaborations and content, in close collaboration with the registry core developers (see below) and `EDAM core developers <https://github.com/edamontology/edamontology#governance-of-edam>`_.  

If you’d like to get involved with the project please mail registry-core@elixir-dk.org.

Registry Core
-------------
Registry Core includes the technical and scientific experts at the heart of the development and curation of bio.tools.  Priorities are set in a quasi-democratic way with the **content leader** (currently Jon Ison) or **software leader** (currently Emil Rydza) having the final say where necessary (in so far as this is meaningful).  Registry Core members must either be funded, or have the intent and some bandwidth, to support the registry in the long-term.  The content and software leader ensures the Registry Core group and all Contributors are listened to and informed.

Members of Registry Core are responsible for agreeing aims and general good practice.  They are expected to advocate bio.tools and (as bandwidth allows) collaborate with one another to help develop the registry software, related technical projects and registry content, *e.g.*:

- add new and improve existing content through collaboration with EDAM Core Developers
- routine content maintenance including quality control
- work collaboratively within the Curation Task Force (see below) and attend Hackathons
- suggest or implement new features
- develop software for the registry and related technical projects
- evaluate the registry and provide feedback, to ensure the registry software is fit for purpose

The content and software leaders are responsible for reporting software development and curation priorities, and progress, to the ELIXIR-DK Management.

Registry Core will assemble virtually or in person as circumstances dictate, in meetings with open agenda and followed up with actions and notes on key recommendations.  All Registry Core members are signed up to the the `registry core mailing list <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributors_guide.html#mailing-list>`_. 

Registry Contributors
---------------------
Registry contributors include anyone who makes significant contributions to the registry content or registry-related software, by whatever means, but have none of the responsibilities or expectations of Registry Core.

An important (but voluntary) role of contributors is to function in an **advisory capacity**, *i.e.* review the progress and priorities of Registry Core and advise them on their priorities and how best to achieve the current aims.  To these ends, the following actions are welcome:
- Read the `status reports <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/status_reports.html>`_ and `changelog <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog_roadmap.html#changelog>`_ and provide feedback on the reported progress and priorities.
- Oversee the registry curation and software development and actively offer constructive advice based on their practical experience, requirements and expertise
- Advocate the registry to colleagues 

The Registry Core will respect this feedback and advice and reflect it in subsequent rounds of registry development and curation.  We very much welcome new contributors: for further information please mail registry-core@elixir-dk.org.

Registry end-users
------------------
We particularly welcome input from end-users from the life science community including scientists, technicians and managers from academia and industry:
- to test, evaluate and critique the registry software and content
- to provide feedback and constructive advice based on their practical experience, requirements and expertise

The Registry Core will respect this feedback and advice and reflect it in subsequent rounds of registry development and curation.
Anyone who is considering using the registry - but especially typical scientist / bioinformatician end-users - are welcome to mail registry-core@elixir-dk.org.
