Governance
==========

bio.tools follows a simple `governance model <https://bio.tools/governance>`_ and is led by the `Danish ELIXIR node <http://elixir-denmark.org>`_ via two Technical Coordinators: `Emil Rydza <mailto:ekry@dtu.dk>`_ is leading the software development and `Jon Ison <mailto:jison@cbs.dtu.dk>`_ is leading the collaborations and content, in close collaboration with the `registry core developers <https://bio.tools/governance>`_ and `EDAM core developers <https://github.com/edamontology/edamontology#governance-of-edam>`_.
