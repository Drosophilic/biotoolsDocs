Contributors Guide
==================

Task management
---------------
*All* tasks in the bio.tools orbit are managed in **sifterapp** (high-level tasks, moderated by Jon) or **JIRA** (low-level software tasks, moderated by Emil).  If you'd like a sifterapp or JIRA account, please mail `Jon Ison <mailto:jison@cbs.dtu.dk>`_ or `Emil Rydza <mailto:ekry@dtu.dk>`_.

- https://biotools.sifterapp.com
 
.. note:: sifterapp is the primary means for technical coordination: collaborators are encouraged to browse tasks, review priorities, make comments and add new tasks.  Bear in mind sifterapp is for *high level* tasks not fine-grained details!
