Project management
============================

bio.tools is led by the `Danish ELIXIR node  <http://elixir-denmark.org>`_ via two Technical Coordinators: `Emil Rydza <mailto:ekry@dtu.dk>`_ is leading the software development and `Jon Ison <mailto:jison@cbs.dtu.dk>`_ is leading the collaborations and content, in close collaboration with the registry and EDAM core developers.  For information about these groups, see our governance models:

- https://bio.tools/governance
- https://github.com/edamontology/edamontology#governance-of-edam

Task management
---------------
*All* tasks in the bio.tools orbit are managed in **sifterapp** (high-level tasks, moderated by Jon) or **JIRA** (low-level software tasks, moderated by Emil).  If you'd like a sifterapp or JIRA account, please mail `Jon Ison <mailto:jison@cbs.dtu.dk>`_ or `Emil Rydza <mailto:ekry@dtu.dk>`_.
 
sifterapp is the primary means for technical coordination: collaborators are encouraged to browse tasks, review priorities, make comments and add new **high-level tasks**:

- https://biotools.sifterapp.com

Bear in mind sifterapp is for *high level* tasks not fine-grained details!

bio.tools community site
------------------------
**GitHub** is used for sharing code and data for all bio.tools-related projects:

- https://github.com/bio-tools/
- https://github.com/bio-tools/biotoolsxsd
- https://github.com/bio-tools/biotoolsregistry
- https://github.com/edamontology/edamontology

Feature requests & issues
-------------------------
GitHub is used to track **fine-grained issues** and is the preferred way to make bio.tools feature requests, content suggestions, EDAM term requests, and bug reports:

- https://github.com/bio-tools/biotoolsregistry/issues
- https://github.com/bio-tools/biotoolsxsd/issues
- https://github.com/edamontology/edamontology/issues

Mailing list
------------
- http://elixirmail.cbs.dtu.dk/mailman/listinfo

Please use the appropriate list:

- **registry** or **edam** for general discussions, questions and help
- **registry-announce** or **edam-announce** for low-traffic announcements
- **registry-core** and **edam-core** for technical discussion amongst the core developers 
- **elixirdk-staff** solely for matters exclusively the concern of ELIXIR-DK.  

For other ELIXIR mailing lists, see:

- https://lists.elixir-europe.org/mailman/listinfo
- **Tools** list is for the ¡°ELIXIR Tools Platform¡±.  It is low-traffic with more political readership.

ELIXIR-DK hangouts
------------------
ELIXIR-DK has a call on the **last Fri of each month @ 11AM CET**.  Technical representatives of ELIXIR-DK institutes routinely attend.  Guests are very welcome: if you'd like to join mail `Jon Ison <mailto:jison@cbs.dtu.dk>`_.  

The hangouts have an open agenda and respond to current critical needs. See the `meeting minutes <http://biotools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/documentors_guide.html>`_.  

 
Status reports
--------------
A short summary of bio.tools activities, including last months actions and next months plans, is released on the last Thu of each month, to be discussed at the monthly hangout (above).  Read the `status reports <http://biotools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/status_reports.html>`_.  See also `https://bio.tools/stats <https://bio.tools/stats>`_ and the `ChangeLog <http://biotools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/changelog.html>`_
