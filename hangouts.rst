Minutes
^^^^^^^
Ad 1) These hangouts should have a practical focus (defined by fixed agenda items) but in-depth technical discussions should be taken elsewhere. We agreed on a set of fixed agenda items, see under 4.

Ad 2) Google hangout worked well today, and we will use this going forward.

Ad 3) All DK partners are expected to provide a representative to these meetings. Currently, we don't expect representatives from industry partners.


Ad 4) 
The fixed agenda items were agreed to be the following:
1) *TASKS* : round-robin catch-up, people say what sifterapp they're working on, asking for help on tasks, reassignment of tasks, etc.
2) *FOCUS* : one person leads a presentation and discussions on a specific point.
3) *STATUS* : people are asked to review the Status Report before the meeting and bring any points for discussion here, including points from partner institutions.
4) *PRIORITIES* : people are asked to review current priorities on sifterapp, for discussion here.
5) *EVENTS & DEADLINES* : people are asked to bring up items to be actioned -> sifter 
6) *KPI's* : Track status of key performance indicators from https://bio.tools/stats 

The fixed agenda items will enable the hangouts to serve three overall purposes
1) To surface if Elixir-DK activities are progressing as planned, and if not, what changes/resources are needed? 
2) To surface information/results (from Elixir-HUB, -events, -meetings) that need to go to the DK-partners or to the HUB. 
3) The meetings serve as a feeder for Elixir-DK Steering group meetings, and similarly, activities/decisions from the Elixir-DK Steering group can be channeled to the agenda of the hangout meetings

Today's actions were:
*Action* Henriette will contact Bernt Guldbrandsen for a representative from AU, QCG for the next meeting (ad 3)
*Action* Maria Maddalena should please send the deadlines + events weekly alert to this quorum from now on (ad 4)

Today's KPI records were:
#User accounts (affiliations) = 262
#Recurrent users = not sure (not recorded?)
#Entries = 2403
#Content changes/edits = not sure (not recorded?)
#Publications : bio.tools technical progress - ideas for future publications  - what's in progress (sifterapp)
