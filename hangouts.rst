Agenda / Minutes:
=================


**Ad 1) Plan for bio.tools content expansion (Jon Ison)**

We currently have ~3000 entries in bio.tools and we are on track with the registry growth targets in the `top down plan <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AM0iLimpT4ClybEKYYdWu52RzJ9GKqUpW2DZflS6_4c/edit>`_
which are:

- 2016 Q4 5000 entries
- 2017 Q1 6250 entries
- 2017 Q2 7500 entries
- 2017 Q3 8750 entries
- 2017 Q4 10000 entries

In the current phase, the primary focus is content, the secondary focus being quality of the content. With this in mind, we decided on two tasks:

**Task 1: Mass-import (assigned to Emil to complete by Q1-2017):**

a) to define the minimum information required for a bio.tools mass-import that would result in a ‘beta-version’ entry in bio.tools.

b) to device a technical solution to implement this task.

c) Immediate action: Emil and Jon to track this task in sifter.


**Criteria for mass-import task solution:**

- Minimum information includes at least Name; website; short description; EDAM descriptors

- The author/owner of the mass-imported tool must be notified by e-mail upon mass-import with quidance to qualify the content to alpha-version.



**Task 2: Student helper – minimal annotation (assigned to Veit to complete with Jon by Q4-2016):**

a) to revisit the idea of minimal annotation of bio.tools content and define the minimum information required for a beta-version entry to upgrade to alpha-version.

b) to write an instruction for student helpers (and for authors/owners see mass-import task) to perform the required annotation.

c) to present a plan for distributing the annotation task by student helpers across the Danish partners.

d) immediate action: Veit and Jon to track this task in sifter


**Ad 2) Sifter app tasks: Are milestones set - questions in this regard (All)**


Milestones for all sifter app tasks (except IDEAS) should be assigned and agreed on Jon Ison. Please keep an eye on your milestones and report at hangout meetings, if you want to change the assigned milestone.

**Ad 3) MBG proposal for bio.tools hackathon on crop and wild-stock tools and databases (Vivi)**

MBG wishes to host an international hackathon in w5 or w 11, 2017, which is great. We will discuss the concrete plans at the next hangout meeting on Nov 25. For that, Vivi will reach out to relevant others and

- define the conceptual workflows for research in the field, which will help to form work-groups at the hackathon, to develop EDAM ontology, as well as expand the list of tools/databases for import, which currently counts ~250 entries. Practically, up to 50 people can attend the event. -

- settle the date for the event by doodle to the registry core list, EDAM core list and this forum.

- settle the location for the event (which could be co-located to other relevant scientific event)

- draft a budget outline for the event


**Ad 4) RNA tools upload progress and emerged EDAM ontology issues (Anne)**

The plan to upload ~400 RNA tools in 2016 is on track. EDAM ontology challenges have emerged, as pointed out by Jan and Anne by email/progress report. 
Jon mentioned the opportunity to use synonyms for semantic enrichment of the EDAM ontology, and that some keywords can go to ‘operations’. Anne should send the ontology suggestions to Jon I, who will help making the EDAM vocabulary match the need from RNA tools field.

**Ad 5) AOB**
no issues were discussed.

Agenda / Minutes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We deviated from the agenda and focused on the main issue raised by Jon : bio.tools content growth must happen faster. More tools and databases need to be loaded to bio.tools and this must be a critical focus until 1) we are on track with it and 2) practical content growth plan that has been endorsed by the Steering Group. To this end - we will consider the following actions to gear sifterapp:

- complete "top down" anaylsis of curation requirements + ELIXIR EXCELERATE WP1 deliverables and milestones due in 2017 (Jon)
- firm-up practical KPIs, metrics for assesment and propose sensible targets.  Map upload targets for WP1 partners & Danish Elixir DK satellite partners (Jon & Henriette)
- map requirements (curation and for milestone & deliverables) to available resources in DK + WP1 partners (Jon in 1st instance) 
- assign milestones (i.e. month-year completion needs) to all sifter tasks in "bio.tools content" tracker, this should reflect upload targets for WP1 partners & Danish Elixir DK satellite partners (Jon in 1st instance)
- clarify purpose of planned 'events' and how these each relate to KPI growth (Jon & Henriette)
- prioritise tooling that is essential for content growth, notably the 'moderation interface' (for mass content imports), 'sandbox' functionality (for intermediate registrations) and tool annotator
- organise a f2f meeting for the DK technical group and WP1 partners : 'content growth tactics' sign-off meeting early December 2016, coinciding with the big release (Jon & Henriette)

Henriette and Jon will continue the discussion off-line and come back by email.

Our next meeting is 28 October 2016 from 11:00 DK-time.

Minutes
^^^^^^^
Ad 1) 
Outreach to TESS (sifter 140, Henriette): Henriette is helping organise a workshop (Fall, 2016) between Bio.tools and TeSS on how to enable cross-links between the two ressources. 

MBG partner involvement (sifter 178, Henriette): Bernt Guldbrandsen will shortly assign a technical member to help the bio.tools expansion (wild stock and plant breeding) and to participate in our meetings.

Training platform (sifter 141, Henriette): It will be valuable to understand which E-learning ressources (online files, videos, slide decks etc) are available from the satellites. Henriette will ask this information from everyone. Hans I is willing to help make a video tutorial on 'how to load tools into Bio.tools' or 'how to get started, using COMPUTEROME'.

Anne Wenzel is in the process of loading 400 RNA-bioinformatics tools onto Bio.tools, and to adjust EDAM ontology accordingly.

Text mining tool (sifter 99, name edamMap, Veit and Jon): This project uses text mining of software descriptions/abstracts/full texts to extract associated EDAM terms. Among other applications, the results can be used for automatic tool annotation.

Workflow generation (sifter 119, Veit and Jon): EDAM provides powerful information to create pipelines for e.g. data analysis involving multiple tools. The study shows how to find applicable pipelines and presents several use cases for the analysis of mass spectrometry data. The work will be presented at ASMS 2016 (mass spectrometry conference) and a paper draft is being prepared.

EDAM Tool Annotator (sifter 46): Improved annotation of tools using EDAM terms. The tool aims to peform a "smart" term search and picking on EDAM in the effort to provide the best exisiting tool annotations; alternatively term suggestions will also be available

Tools used by ELIXIR trainers (sifter 60): finish curration for high-value tools to trainers.

Ad 2) No volunteer today. But great opportunity if needing input/bounce off idea
Ad 3) Credits to Emil for expanding the bio.tools statistics to comprise more parameters. The report could perhaps be made to contain the 'priority' dimension (Henriette and Jon to liase before the meeting, about this)
ad 4) Not done. We really should.
ad 5) Not covered, due to time pressure.
ad 6) Henriette will contact Emil about KPIs and tracking these

Minutes
^^^^^^^
Ad 1) These hangouts should have a practical focus (defined by fixed agenda items) but in-depth technical discussions should be taken elsewhere. We agreed on a set of fixed agenda items, see under 4.

Ad 2) Google hangout worked well today, and we will use this going forward.

Ad 3) All DK partners are expected to provide a representative to these meetings. Currently, we don't expect representatives from industry partners.


Ad 4) 
The fixed agenda items were agreed to be the following:
1) *TASKS* : round-robin catch-up, people say what sifterapp they're working on, asking for help on tasks, reassignment of tasks, etc.
2) *FOCUS* : one person leads a presentation and discussions on a specific point.
3) *STATUS* : people are asked to review the Status Report before the meeting and bring any points for discussion here, including points from partner institutions.
4) *PRIORITIES* : people are asked to review current priorities on sifterapp, for discussion here.
5) *EVENTS & DEADLINES* : people are asked to bring up items to be actioned -> sifter 
6) *KPI's* : Track status of key performance indicators from https://bio.tools/stats 

The fixed agenda items will enable the hangouts to serve three overall purposes
1) To surface if Elixir-DK activities are progressing as planned, and if not, what changes/resources are needed? 
2) To surface information/results (from Elixir-HUB, -events, -meetings) that need to go to the DK-partners or to the HUB. 
3) The meetings serve as a feeder for Elixir-DK Steering group meetings, and similarly, activities/decisions from the Elixir-DK Steering group can be channeled to the agenda of the hangout meetings

Today's actions were:
*Action* Henriette will contact Bernt Guldbrandsen for a representative from AU, QCG for the next meeting (ad 3)
*Action* Maria Maddalena should please send the deadlines + events weekly alert to this quorum from now on (ad 4)

Today's KPI records were:
#User accounts (affiliations) = 262
#Recurrent users = not sure (not recorded?)
#Entries = 2403
#Content changes/edits = not sure (not recorded?)
#Publications : bio.tools technical progress - ideas for future publications  - what's in progress (sifterapp)
