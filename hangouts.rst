Thanks to everyone who managed to join this technically challenged meeting ! It seems that hangouts aren’t suitable for meetings of 10 participants or more, and so the next TC (Feb 24, 11:00 CET) will take place in another way (Action Henriette),

Please have a look at the revised (27/1 p.m.!) status report here `<http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/status_reports.html <http://>`_ 

 


Agenda and Minutes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Ad 1) Hackathon at Aarhus University Feb 2-3 2017: Outstanding issues (Vivi Gregersen) 10 min**

Currently 15 people have signed up to this hackathon, everyone is welcome to attend and can study the program AND register here https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tVemqzmus8BpQxfPZRmh5PGmIe64F9a72OKmPhfz1sk/edit#heading=h.p1b4r4t4pje3 
Jon will share a spreadsheet template with Vivi, to help define conceptual workflows, relevant tools and annotation (Action Jon)
Hans will demonstrate the Tool Annotator as requested – Jon should give directions to Hans as to timing and duration of this (Action Jon).

**Ad 2) Status on RTH - RNA tools (Anne Wenzel) 5 min** 

The upload of ~400 tools that were scheduled for end 2016 has been paused by RTH. This is due to concerns from RTH, as to how the ontology helps in finding the right tools, caused both by limitations in search function support and a non-implemented EDAM ontology extension that RTH plan to do. Anne, Emil and Jon will address these concerns off-line, update the list of critique points to address re: registry developments here https://biotools.sifterapp.com/issues/317 and identify a new plan for uploading the tools, involving Jan Gorodkin (Action Anne).


**Ad 3) Tool Annotator – status (Hans Ienasescu) 10 min**

The Tool Annotator is currently not integrated with bio.tools but it will be after user feed-back on the current version, at the hackathon in Aarhus Feb 2-3. Here the participants will compare and critique the difference in annotating using the Tool annotator, the bioportal and the current function in bio.tools and Hans will harvest the best modus and upgrade the Tool Annotator accordingly – and then settle on a plan, with Emil, Jon, to integrate it with bio.tools (Action Hans)


**Ad 4) Experience from Proteomics workshop Bio.tools outreach  (Veit Schwämmle) 10 min** 

Approximately 30 people attended the workshop. These were both Ph.D. students, postdocs and senior researchers. The main outcome was outreach i.e. to introduce ELIXIR and the bio.tools registry to the proteomics community. Another outcome was to define workflows in proteomics analysis, which is useful not only to the registry but also to the ELIXIR training platform, who attended as well (Niall Beard). The event could not have taken place without the ELIXIR-DK financial support, which was a little hard to come by. ELIXIR DK would benefit from an operational strategy that lowers the bar on resource decisions and executing these (Action Henriette).

**Ad 5) Highlights from ‘User feedback from the UI tests’ see here  (Kenzo Hugo) 10 min**

Several constructive points of critique were raised by the report. Salva also raised important points at this meeting. Jon and Emil are grateful for this helpful critique and kindly request these be noted in the sifter task here https://biotools.sifterapp.com/issues/317 where they will action them (i.e. link them with the roadmap) and solve them as soon as possible/feasible. Again – everyone is welcome (and needed) to help solve these issues – please coordinate with Jon, Emil. 

**Ad 6) Access to the code repository (Hervé Menager) 10 min**

HH was not online for this point. Please fill in the points that were made (Action Hervé)

**Ad 7) New curator in DK (yea!) – roles and tasks, inspirational 5 min**

Hans Ienasescu has been hired at UCPH, Bioinformatics Centre, for 1 year as of Feb 15, 2017 as a full-time registry curator. Due to time constraints, this point has been postponed for the next meeting.

**Ad 8) AOB**
None

Our current primary focus is content, the secondary focus being quality of the content in bio.tools 
Current #entries 2664 
# affiliations 145. 
2016-Q4 target is 5000 entries.


Agenda / Minutes:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**Ad 1) Welcome everyone - especially to Hervé, Kenzo and Josep - brief sharing of plans regarding content expansion and more**
Kenzo joined Hervé’s team recently and will be focusing on the workbench integration enabler component for e.g. galaxy. 
Content-wise, Kenzo will be loading ~30 highly curated entries authored by Institute Pasteur on to Bio.tools and sponsor community engagement. 
Kenzo wishes to contribute to software development and is invited to do so by e-mail to registry-support@elixir-dk.org (John Ison, Emil Rydza, Lukasz Berger, Peter Løngren) in the first instance, with an option to set up a more formal structure if necessary.


**Ad 2) KPI monitoring: entry growth curve and contributors growth curve #72 (Emil Rydza, 2016-Q4)**

Good progress: The two curves have been constructed and will be made visible in November, here https://bio.tools/stats 

We will consider posting other statistics e.g. growth in number of users and number of views, when we launch the registry to enable community engagement.

**Ad 3) Settle on 'minimum information for content import to staging area #293' - any further input? (Henriette)**

We confirmed the following as the minimum information:

- Name
- Homepage
- Description
- EDAM Topic/descriptors

Additional information will be welcome but given default values i.e. not necessary/possible to fill in:

- Publications
- Type of service

**ADDENDUM Jon Ison 28/11/16**

Concerning the minimum information requirement for "beta" entries, see https://github.com/bio-tools/biotoolsSchema#information-requirements:

- name 
- toolID
- homepage
- description
- tool type
- topic
- function

topic and function can be assigned semi-automatically using `edamMap <https://github.com/edamontology/edammap>`_ and could default to "Topic" and "Operation" if necessary (undesirable).

All entries labelled as "beta" initially until manually inspected.  

ACTION: Jon & Emil to firm up validation / inforrmation requirement for labelling ("beta", "standard", "validated" etc.)

# end of addendnum

  
Anders Dannesboe is assuming a new position on Dec 1 and is nearly done with a script to transfer spreadsheets including tools for mass-import to XML - Anders will handover this task to be finalised/implemented by Jon and Hans for task #107. 

Jon should please close task 293 and release full steam on task #107 

**Ad 4) Status and plans concerning implementation of the staging area for mass-import and 'easy' community-driven content expansion #107 (Emil Rydza, 2017-Q1)** 

Not discussed in absence of John. It’s not clear if John or Emil is leading this critical task – please clarify between you.

**Ad 5) RNA tools upload progress #62 and  (Anne, Q4-2016)**

On track. 380 tools expected to be loaded onto bio.tools. Anne will discuss the RNA ontology list with Josep.

**Ad 6) MBG proposal for Bio.tools hackathon on crop and wild-stock tools and databases #178 (Vivi, milestone not assigned)**

The date for this hackathon has been settled for 2.-3. February 2017 and will take place in Aarhus, Denmark. Henriette will look for budget coverage. Vivi and colleagues will continue to work to specify the conceptual workflows involved. 

**Ad 7) Issues on settled milestones - needs for revision ? (all)**

None

**Ad 8). Carry forward input concerning upcoming WP1/ELIXIR-DK partners TC on Dec 2nd at 10 a.m. UK / 11 a.m. DK**

None

**Ad 9) AOB**

None


**Next meeting will take place on January 27, 2017 (as December 30 is cancelled)**

Agenda / Minutes:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


**Ad 1) Plan for bio.tools content expansion (Jon Ison)**

We currently have ~2700 entries in bio.tools and - assuming additions in 2016 Q4 occur as scheduled - are about on track with the registry growth targets in the `top down plan <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AM0iLimpT4ClybEKYYdWu52RzJ9GKqUpW2DZflS6_4c/edit>`_
which are:

- 2016 Q4 5000 entries
- 2017 Q1 6250 entries
- 2017 Q2 7500 entries
- 2017 Q3 8750 entries
- 2017 Q4 10000 entries

In the current phase, the primary focus is content, the secondary focus being quality of the content. With this in mind, we decided on two tasks:

**Task 1: Mass-import - (assigned to Emil & Jon to complete by Q1-2017):**

a) to define the minimum information required for a bio.tools mass-import that would result in a ‘beta-version’ entry in bio.tools.
   
b) to device a technical solution to implement this task.

c) to identify candidate collections suitable for import en masse

d) Immediate action: Emil and Jon to track this task in sifter.

- https://biotools.sifterapp.com/issues/107
- https://biotools.sifterapp.com/issues/107
- https://biotools.sifterapp.com/issues/295
  
**Criteria for mass-import task solution:**

- Minimum information includes at least Name; website; short description; EDAM descriptors

- The author/owner of the mass-imported tool must be notified by e-mail upon mass-import with guidance to qualify the content to production version.



**Task 2: Student helper – minimal annotation (assigned to Veit to complete with Jon by Q4-2016):**

a) to revisit the idea of minimal annotation of bio.tools content and define the minimum information required for a beta-version entry to upgrade to production version.

b) to write an instruction for student helpers (and for authors/owners see mass-import task) to perform the required annotation.

c) to present a plan for distributing the annotation task by student helpers across the Danish partners.

d) immediate action: Veit and Jon to track this task in sifter


Jon Ison note (1/11/2016)

- https://biotools.sifterapp.com/issues/294


**Ad 2) Sifter app tasks: Are milestones set - questions in this regard (All)**


Milestones for all sifter app tasks (except IDEAS) should be assigned and agreed on Jon Ison. Please keep an eye on your milestones and report at hangout meetings, if you want to change the assigned milestone.

**Ad 3) MBG proposal for bio.tools hackathon on crop and wild-stock tools and databases (Vivi)**

MBG wishes to host an international hackathon in w5 or w 11, 2017, which is great. We will discuss the concrete plans at the next hangout meeting on Nov 25. For that, Vivi will reach out to relevant others and

- define the conceptual workflows for research in the field, which will help to form work-groups at the hackathon, to develop EDAM ontology, as well as expand the list of tools/databases for import, which currently counts ~250 entries. Practically, up to 50 people can attend the event. -

- settle the date for the event by doodle to the registry core list, EDAM core list and this forum.

- settle the location for the event (which could be co-located to other relevant scientific event)

- draft a budget outline for the event


**Ad 4) RNA tools upload progress and emerged EDAM ontology issues (Anne)**

The plan to upload ~400 RNA tools in 2016 is on track. EDAM ontology challenges have emerged, as pointed out by Jan and Anne by email/progress report. 
Jon mentioned the opportunity to use synonyms for semantic enrichment of the EDAM ontology, and that some keywords can go to ‘operations’. Anne should send the ontology suggestions to Jon I, who will help making the EDAM vocabulary match the need from RNA tools field.

**Ad 5) AOB**
no issues were discussed.

Agenda / Minutes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We deviated from the agenda and focused on the main issue raised by Jon : bio.tools content growth must happen faster. More tools and databases need to be loaded to bio.tools and this must be a critical focus until 1) we are on track with it and 2) practical content growth plan that has been endorsed by the Steering Group. To this end - we will consider the following actions to gear sifterapp:

- complete "top down" anaylsis of curation requirements + ELIXIR EXCELERATE WP1 deliverables and milestones due in 2017 (Jon)
- firm-up practical KPIs, metrics for assesment and propose sensible targets.  Map upload targets for WP1 partners & Danish Elixir DK satellite partners (Jon & Henriette)
- map requirements (curation and for milestone & deliverables) to available resources in DK + WP1 partners (Jon in 1st instance) 
- assign milestones (i.e. month-year completion needs) to all sifter tasks in "bio.tools content" tracker, this should reflect upload targets for WP1 partners & Danish Elixir DK satellite partners (Jon in 1st instance)
- clarify purpose of planned 'events' and how these each relate to KPI growth (Jon & Henriette)
- prioritise tooling that is essential for content growth, notably the 'moderation interface' (for mass content imports), 'sandbox' functionality (for intermediate registrations) and tool annotator
- organise a f2f meeting for the DK technical group and WP1 partners : 'content growth tactics' sign-off meeting early December 2016, coinciding with the big release (Jon & Henriette)

Henriette and Jon will continue the discussion off-line and come back by email.

Our next meeting is 28 October 2016 from 11:00 DK-time.

Minutes
^^^^^^^
Ad 1) 
Outreach to TESS (sifter 140, Henriette): Henriette is helping organise a workshop (Fall, 2016) between Bio.tools and TeSS on how to enable cross-links between the two ressources. 

MBG partner involvement (sifter 178, Henriette): Bernt Guldbrandsen will shortly assign a technical member to help the bio.tools expansion (wild stock and plant breeding) and to participate in our meetings.

Training platform (sifter 141, Henriette): It will be valuable to understand which E-learning ressources (online files, videos, slide decks etc) are available from the satellites. Henriette will ask this information from everyone. Hans I is willing to help make a video tutorial on 'how to load tools into Bio.tools' or 'how to get started, using COMPUTEROME'.

Anne Wenzel is in the process of loading 400 RNA-bioinformatics tools onto Bio.tools, and to adjust EDAM ontology accordingly.

Text mining tool (sifter 99, name edamMap, Veit and Jon): This project uses text mining of software descriptions/abstracts/full texts to extract associated EDAM terms. Among other applications, the results can be used for automatic tool annotation.

Workflow generation (sifter 119, Veit and Jon): EDAM provides powerful information to create pipelines for e.g. data analysis involving multiple tools. The study shows how to find applicable pipelines and presents several use cases for the analysis of mass spectrometry data. The work will be presented at ASMS 2016 (mass spectrometry conference) and a paper draft is being prepared.

EDAM Tool Annotator (sifter 46): Improved annotation of tools using EDAM terms. The tool aims to peform a "smart" term search and picking on EDAM in the effort to provide the best exisiting tool annotations; alternatively term suggestions will also be available

Tools used by ELIXIR trainers (sifter 60): finish curration for high-value tools to trainers.

Ad 2) No volunteer today. But great opportunity if needing input/bounce off idea
Ad 3) Credits to Emil for expanding the bio.tools statistics to comprise more parameters. The report could perhaps be made to contain the 'priority' dimension (Henriette and Jon to liase before the meeting, about this)
ad 4) Not done. We really should.
ad 5) Not covered, due to time pressure.
ad 6) Henriette will contact Emil about KPIs and tracking these

Minutes
^^^^^^^
Ad 1) These hangouts should have a practical focus (defined by fixed agenda items) but in-depth technical discussions should be taken elsewhere. We agreed on a set of fixed agenda items, see under 4.

Ad 2) Google hangout worked well today, and we will use this going forward.

Ad 3) All DK partners are expected to provide a representative to these meetings. Currently, we don't expect representatives from industry partners.


Ad 4) 
The fixed agenda items were agreed to be the following:
1) *TASKS* : round-robin catch-up, people say what sifterapp they're working on, asking for help on tasks, reassignment of tasks, etc.
2) *FOCUS* : one person leads a presentation and discussions on a specific point.
3) *STATUS* : people are asked to review the Status Report before the meeting and bring any points for discussion here, including points from partner institutions.
4) *PRIORITIES* : people are asked to review current priorities on sifterapp, for discussion here.
5) *EVENTS & DEADLINES* : people are asked to bring up items to be actioned -> sifter 
6) *KPI's* : Track status of key performance indicators from https://bio.tools/stats 

The fixed agenda items will enable the hangouts to serve three overall purposes
1) To surface if Elixir-DK activities are progressing as planned, and if not, what changes/resources are needed? 
2) To surface information/results (from Elixir-HUB, -events, -meetings) that need to go to the DK-partners or to the HUB. 
3) The meetings serve as a feeder for Elixir-DK Steering group meetings, and similarly, activities/decisions from the Elixir-DK Steering group can be channeled to the agenda of the hangout meetings

Today's actions were:
*Action* Henriette will contact Bernt Guldbrandsen for a representative from AU, QCG for the next meeting (ad 3)
*Action* Maria Maddalena should please send the deadlines + events weekly alert to this quorum from now on (ad 4)

Today's KPI records were:
#User accounts (affiliations) = 262
#Recurrent users = not sure (not recorded?)
#Entries = 2403
#Content changes/edits = not sure (not recorded?)
#Publications : bio.tools technical progress - ideas for future publications  - what's in progress (sifterapp)
