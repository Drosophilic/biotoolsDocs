Attributes

Name
^^^^
*Canonical software name assigned by the software developer or service provider*

The name has a 100 character limit and may only contain uppercase and lowercase letters, decimal digits, period, comma, dash, colon, plus symbol, semicolon and parentheses.

- use the name that is commonly used to refer to the software
- preserve the canonical capitalisation, if any *e.g.* "ExPASy" 
- use the short form of the name, if available *e.g.* use "ExPASy" not "ExPASy Bioinformatics Resource Portal"
- do not include general or technical terms such as "software", "application", "server", "service", "SOAP", "REST", "RESTful" *etc." unless these are part of the common name, with two exceptions

  - for APIs, use the pattern ``name API`` *e.g.* ``Open PHACTS API".  
  - for Web services (SOAP+WSDL), use the pattern ``name web service`` *e.g.* ``EMMA web service".  

- for database portals, use common abbreviation if available, *e.g.*  "PDB" not "The Protein Databank"
- for software that essentially just wraps or provides an interface to some other tool, use the pattern ``toolName providerName`` where ``providerName`` is the name of some institute, workbench, collection etc. *e.g.* cufflinks cloud IFB".  Do not misappropriate the original name!
- in case of mulitple related entries which may all include a common tool in part of their name, be consistent
