All developments of bio.tools software and content are informed by the ELIXIR EXCELERATE application (granted in April 2015), in light of community input (see GitHub <https://github.com/bio-tools/biotoolsregistry/issues>`_) and events on the ground.  

For a summary of planned developments including priorities and milestones see https://biotools.sifterapp.com/.
